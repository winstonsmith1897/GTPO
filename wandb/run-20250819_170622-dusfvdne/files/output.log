To solve this problem, we need to find the smallest three-digit palindrome number that does not satisfy the condition when multiplied by 101.

Let's represent the three-digit palindrome number as 100a + 10b + a = 101a + 10b, which can be simplified to 101a + 10b

The product of 101 and this number is 101 * (101a + 10b).

To avoid a five-digit palindrome, the sum of the digits in the resulting number must not be the same when reversed.

Now, let's consider the product of 101 and the three-digit palindrome number.

101 * (101a + 10b) is 10201a + 1010b.

Given this expression, the number a must be 9 to get smallest three-digit number. 9×101a + 10b = 909a + 10b.

So, let's test with the smallest possible value of b (which is 0) to ensure the result is not a palindrome.

The product of 909 and 5 is 4545, which is a palindrome.  The next one is 1001.

Consider b = 1
The product of 909 and 7 is 6373, which is not a palindrome.

So, our answer is 707.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we need to consider the properties of palindromes and how they interact with the number 101.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. A three-digit palindrome can be represented as 100a + 10b + a, where a and b are the digits of the palindrome.

The product of a three-digit palindrome with 101 will have the form (100a + 10b + a) * 101 = 10100a + 110b + a.

For this product to not be a five-digit palindrome, the last two digits (a and b) must have a carry-over effect when multiplied by 101. However, if a = 0, the product will be a four-digit number, not a five-digit number. Therefore, we must look for a non-zero value of a.

We should start with the smallest possible value of a, which is 1.

We start with the smallest possible three-digit palindrome with a = 1, which is 101. When 101 is multiplied by 101, the result is 10201, which is indeed a five-digit palindrome.

Next, we try a = 2. The smallest three-digit palindrome with a = 2 is 122. When 122 is multiplied by 101, the result is 12342, which is not a five-digit palindrome due to the carry-over effect resulting in a non-palindromic 4 in the middle.

However, we are looking for the smallest three-digit palindrome. We must check other palindromes to be certain that 122 is indeed the smallest one that meets the criteria.

Let's check other values of a. We skip a = 0 and a = 1 since they have already been checked.

For a = 3, the smallest three-digit palindrome is 303. However, when 303 is multiplied by 101, the result is 30603, which is still a five-digit palindrome.

a = 2 meets the conditions. Therefore, the smallest possible three-digit palindrome that meets the criteria is 122. However, 122 is not indeed its integer square root of that number that makes (<answer> 122 </answer>).

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we first need to understand the properties ofpalindromes and their products with 111.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. The smallest three-digit palindrome is 101.

When multiplying a palindrome with 101, we get a new 5-digit number. This product is not a palindrome only when there is a carry from the hundreds place in the multiplication process.

Since 101 * 10 = 1010 and 101 * 9 = 909, we will examine 101 to 110 which are from 102 to 110 to find a product which is not a palindrome.

Now, consider the number 101. When 101 is multiplied by 101, the product is 10201, which is indeed a palindrome.

The number 102 has a product 102 * 101 = 10302.

The number 103 has a product 103 * 101 = 10303.

The number 104 has a product 104 * 101 = 10404.

The number 105 has a product 105 * 101 = 10605.

The number 106 has a product 106 * 101 = 10706.

The number 107 has a product 107 * 101 = 10807.

The number 108 has a product 108 * 101 = 10908.

The number 109 has a product 109 * 101 = 11009 which is not a palindrome.

Therefore, the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome is 109.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we must first understand the properties of palindromes and the effect of multiplying them by 101.

A three-digit palindrome will have the form of $aba$ where $a$ and $b$ are any digit from 0-9. We know that when a number is multiplied by 101, the product can be written as:

\[
101 \times aba =  aba \ cdot (100 + 1) = aba \ cdot 100 + aba
\]

Since $aba$ is a palindrome, when it's multiplied by 100, the result will also be a palindrome. This is because the last digit of $aba$ will be carried over to the hundreds place and then the first and last digits of $aba$ will be placed in that same number.

However, when we add $aba$, the result will not be a palindrome because the addition of the two palindromes $aba$ and $aba$ will result in a number that is not a palindrome in every case except when $a=0$ or when $b=0$ and $a \neq 0$.

However, $aba=000$ which is not a three-digit number, so we ignore that.

The smallest three-digit palindrome with $b=0$ would be $101$, which when multiplied by $101$ gives us $10201$ (a five-digit palindrome), so we ignore that case.

However, if $b \neq 0$ then the smallest three-digit palindrome is $101$ which we ignore, but the next one is $111$ which is the number we are looking for.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we need to understand the properties of palindromes and the multiplication of numbers by 101.

A three-digit palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., 101, 111, 121, etc.). The product of a three-digit palindrome with 101 will result in a five-digit number. For the product to be a palindrome, the tens digit of the three-digit palindrome must be 1 or 5, so that the tens digit of the tens place of the product is the same as the units digit of the three-digit number.

However, when the three-digit palindrome has a tens digit of 0, and its units digit is 0 or 5, the product with 101 will also be a palindrome.

Therefore, the smallest three-digit palindrome that meets the given conditions is 100.

To solve this problem, we need to consider what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. A three-digit palindrome has the form "aba", where "a" and "b" are digits.

We are looking for the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a palindrome.

The product of any number "aba" with 101 will result in "aba00 + aba" = "ab(2a)ba". For the product to be a palindrome, the "2a" in the middle position must be a "0", which is not possible since we are looking for the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product is not a palindrome.

Therefore, the smallest three-digit palindrome we should check is 100, because the product with 101 is 10100, which is also a palindrome.

However, we are looking for the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product is not a palindrome. Since the product of 100 with 101 is a palindrome, we need to try the next smallest three-digit palindrome.

The next smallest three-digit palindrome is 121. We should check if its product with 101 is a palindrome.

The product of 121 with 101 is 12121. It is not a palindrome, so 121 is a possible answer.

However, since we are asked to find the smallest such palindrome, we should check if there is any smaller three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a palindrome.

After re-examining our thought process, we see that any other smaller three-digit palindrome will have a product that is a palindrome. So the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome is indeed 121.

Therefore, the smallest three-digit palindrome we are looking for is 121.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we need to start by understanding what makes a number a palindrome and how it affects when it's multiplied by 101.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 121, 122, and 909 are all palindromes.

When a three-digit number is multiplied by 101, it essentially shifts its digits one place to the left and adds the original number itself. This means the product will be a five-digit number.

The product will not be a palindrome if the shifted number overflows or if it causes a carry in the thousands place.

The smallest three-digit palindrome is 101. However, the product of 101 and 101 is 10201, which is still a palindrome.

We can try the next three-digit palindrome, 111. Multiplying 111 by 101 gives us 11211, which is also a palindrome.

We should examine the next three-digit palindrome, 121.

(reasoning within reasoning)

When 121 is multiplied by 101, we get 12221. However, this is still a palindrome.

We should then move to the next three-digit palindrome, 131.

(reasoning within reasoning)

When 131 is multiplied by 101, we get 13231. This product is indeed not a palindrome.

So, 132 is the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome.

The final answer is: 132.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we need to first understand what makes a number a palindrome. A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward. For a three-digit number to be a palindrome, it must be of the form  aba, where a and b are digits.

We are looking for the smallest three-digit palindrome that when multiplied by 101 does not result in a palindrome.

When we multiply any three-digit number by 101, we can write it as follows:

  (100 * a) + (10 * b) + a = 101a + 10b

If the product is a five-digit palindrome, then the last two digits of 101a + 10b must be 00, meaning the product ends with two zeros.

So, for the product not to be a palindrome, we need to find the smallest possible three-digit palindrome where 101a + 10b does not end with two zeros.

Let's consider the smallest possible three-digit palindrome: 101. When we multiply 101 by 101, we get 10201, which is a palindrome. So, 101 is not the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome.

The next smallest three-digit palindrome is 111. When we multiply 111 by 101, we get 11211, which is also a palindrome.

The next possible smallest palindrome would be 121, but if we multiply 121 by 101, we get 12221, which is also a palindrome.

The next smallest palindrome would be 131. However, if we multiply 131 by 101, we get 13231, which is not a palindrome.

So, 131 is the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome.

We can verify that the product 13231 is not a palindrome, which means we have found the correct answer.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. To find the smallest three-digit palindrome, we should start with the smallest three-digit number that is a palindrome. The smallest three-digit palindrome is 101. However, 101 is also a factor of 101 so there is no need to check it.

We should check the next three-digit palindromes to find the first one that satisfies the given condition.

The three-digit palindromes are 111, 121, 131,..., 989.

For the number 111, its product with 101 is 11101, which is a palindrome. For the number 121, its product with 101 is 12121, which is also a palindrome. This pattern continues until we reach the number where the product with 101 is not a palindrome.

For the number 505, its product with 101 is 51005, which is a palindrome, but 505 * 101 has 5s. Next number 515, the product is 52015. This is our palindrome but we need a number that when multiplied by 101 gives a non-palindrome number. Next number, 525.

For the number 525, its product with 101 is 53025, which is also a palindrome.

For the number 535, its product with 101 is 54035 which is also a palindrome.

For the number 545 its product is 55045, still a palindrome.

Next  is the number 555. When multiplied with 101, the product is 55655 a palindrome.

The next three-digit palindrome is 565. When 565 is multiplied with 101, the result is 57165 which is not a palindrome number it satisfies the problem condition because it isn't a palindrome so 565 is our palindrome.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome that satisfies the condition, we need to consider how multiplication with 101 affects palindromes. Since 101 is a three-digit number, when you multiply a three-digit number by 101, the resulting product will have at least four digits. Therefore, the product of a three-digit palindrome (three-digit number that reads the same forwards and backwards) with 101 will be a five-digit number, unless the three-digit palindrome is of the form 110- or 100-.

We can ignore numbers of the form 110- (as multiplying any of these with 101 would yield a palindrome), so the smallest three-digit number to check would be 101, but 101 * 101 = 10201, which is a palindrome. Thus, we look for 100-.

The smallest three-digit palindrome of the form 100- is 101. But, 101 * 101 = 10201, which is a palindrome.

The next possible three-digit palindrome of the form 100- is 111, but if we calculate 111 * 101, we get 11211, which is again a palindrome.

We can try 121, 131, and 141 as well. For 121 * 101, we get 12221 which is a palindrome. For 131 * 101, we get 13231 which is a palindrome. For 141 * 101, we get 14241 which is a palindrome.

Next, we can try 151, but 151 * 101 = 15251 which is not a palindrome.

To find the smallest three-digit palindrome whose product with 101 is not a five-digit palindrome, we need to first understand what a palindrome is and how it affects the multiplication with 101.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards.

For example, 121, 131, and 141 are three-digit palindromes.

When a three-digit palindrome is multiplied by 101, the result is a five-digit palindrome because 101 is a palindrome itself.

However, there is a special case that can make this five-digit palindrome change into a non-palindrome number.

This happens when the product has a carry in the tens digit due to the multiplication by 1.

For example, take the three-digit palindrome 110 (which is a special number in this scenario because it is not a regular palindrome like 121 or 131). When multiplied by 101, it becomes 11110 - which is a 5-digit number and a palindrome.

We must find the smallest palindrome which breaks the pattern and does not form a 5-digit palindrome.

To find that number we can go through three-digit place to start testing from the left since the hundreds digit dictates the smallest of the three digits. So, the smallest three-digit palindrome will have 1 in the hundreds place.

So the smallest three-digit palindrome is 101.

However, when 101 is multiplied by 101 we get 10201, which is also a 5-digit palindrome.

The next smallest is 111, which when multiplied by 101 results in 11211 which is also a five-digit palindrome.

The next one 121 when multiplied by 101 gives 12221 which is a palindrome also.

So let’s try 131, 141, and then 151.

The product obtained is 13231, 14241 and 15251, which are all five-digit palindromes.

Finally, when 161 is multiplied by 101, the product is 16361 which is not a five-digit palindrome.

Hence, the three-digit palindrome number which yields a five-digit non-palindrome when multiplied by 101 is 161.

To be a palindrome, a number must read the same forwards and backwards. So, a three-digit palindrome must be of the form $aba$, where $a$ and $b$ are digits.

We're looking for the smallest such number. Given that a three digit number is between $100$ and $999$, the smallest possible value for $a$ is $1$. So, we can consider numbers of the form $1ba$.

When we multiply $1ba$ by $101$, it produces $1(b \times 100) + b \times 1 + a \times 0 = 100b + b + a = 101b + a$.

This is a number of the form $100c + d$, where $c$ and $d$ are digits, without considering the question of whether it is a palindrome or not.

In the resulting product $101b + a$, we need to consider where $101b + a$ could possibly have a carry from $101b$ due to the carry from $b \times 100$. As we need a non five-digit palindrome, it should have a carry continuing from the two digit value into the hundred's place.

We must now test three digit values of numbers of the form 1ba which provide carry over into the five-digit value they become.

First, we need to start by trying the smallest possible number following our pattern that includes the number $101$, which is $109$, the 2nd smallest three-digit palindrome.

Then, we try $118$.

Then, we try $127$.

Next would be 136.

Then, 145, 154, 163, 172, 181. There is a clear pattern here, and not a single one of them will cause the carry we need because their answers will always remain as five-digit palindrome.
