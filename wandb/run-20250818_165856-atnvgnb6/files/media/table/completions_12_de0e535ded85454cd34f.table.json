Since 1 foot = 12 inches:\n   \\[\n   8 \\text{ inches} = \\frac{8}{12} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the total snow depth after the second day:\n   \\[\n   0.5 \\text{ feet} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{1}{2} \\text{ feet} + \\frac{2}{3} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{3}{6} \\text{ feet} + \\frac{4}{6} \\text{ feet} = \\frac{7}{6} \\text{ feet} = 1.1667 \\text{ feet}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Snow Melting Over Two Days**:\n   After the third day, 2 inches of snow melts.
